Executing Algorithms
----------------------------------------------------

1. Which steps perform input?
	step 4 

2. Which steps perform output?
	step 9 

3. Which steps modify the value of a variable?
	step 10 

4. Which steps involve a mathematical operation?
	steps 6,7,10

5. Which steps perform iteration? 
	step 10 

6. This algorithm contains a "bug": a logical error that results in
incorrect output.  Where is the problem?  How can it be fixed?
	The problem is in 7 because the height will always be one away and not equal.

3 Creating Algorithms
----------------------------------------------------

Writing Simple Algorithms
____________________________________________________

1. Write your algorithm
	1. Create a variable named "height"
	2. Create a variable named "row" 
	3. Create a height of 3 
`	4. Create a row that is 2 

2. What was incorrect or imprecise about your algorithm? 
	I should've combined steps 1 and 3 and 2 and 4 to make the algorithm more efficient. 

Writing Algorithms that Require Input
____________________________________________________

1. Write your algorithm
	1. Create a variable named "height" and designate this on a horizontal axis 
	2. Create a variable named "row" and designate this on a vertical axis 
	3. Ask your partner how tall they would like the generic rectangle (either 4 or 5)
	4. Graph this response on the axis for the variable named height
	5. Ask your partner how wide they would like the generic rectangle ( either 2 or 3)
	6. Graph this response on the axis for the variable named row 
	7. Fill in the space of the rows until they match the height
Starting over 
	1. Place your writing device on the center of the paper.
	2. Choose a number either 4 or 5 label this height 
	3. Draw a straight line that is equal in inches to the number you've chosen, this is height. 
	4. Turn right
	5. Choose a number that is either 2 or 3, this is width. 
	6. Draw a straight line that is equal in inches to the number you've chosen, this is width.  
	7. Turn Right 
	8. Repeat steps 3-6
	

2. What was incorrect or imprecise about your algorithm? 
	I did not specify that it should be filled in on a graph. (Will go back and edit). Not going to do it as a graph, starting over.

Writing Algorithms that Require Calculations
____________________________________________________

1. Write your algorithm
	1. Create a variable named "height" and designate this on a horizontal axis 
	2. Create a variable named "row" and designate this on a vertical axis 
	3. Ask your partner how tall they would like the generic right triangle (this should be an even number between 2 and 6) 
	4. Graph this response in the axis for the variable named height 
	5. Take the height of your generic right triangle and half the number
	6. Graph this number in the axis named row
Starting over 
	1. Place your writing device on the center of the paper.
	2. Choose a number between 2 and 4, this is your length 
	3.create a straight line that is equal in inches to the number chosen.
	4.turn your writing device 45 degrees
	5. Draw a straight line equal to the length you've choosen.
	6. Repeat steps 4 and 5


2. What was incorrect or imprecise about your algorithm? 
	The triangle was not an official right triangle

Writing  a more Complicated Algorithm
____________________________________________________

1. Write your algorithm 
	1. Choose a number between 2 and 5
	2. Place your pen/pencil in the center of the page.
	3. Create a line going forward that is equal in inches to the number that was chosen
	4. Follow around the center of where you started your line going clockwise from the end of the line keeping a radius that is equal to the length of your line for 360 degrees. 
	5. Take the same number choosen and draw a forward line that is equal in inches.
	6. Turn to the right 
	7. Continue step 5 four times 
Starting Over 
	1. Choose a number between 1 and 5 
	2. Input this number into the following equations as "S".
	3. P1=3S
	4. P2=4S
	5. P3=2Ï€S
	6. Add together P1,P2,and P3
